<h1 align=center>Next.js Travel Booking App</h1>

<br clear="left" />

This project is a Next.js Travel Booking App that allows users to browse and reserve travel tours through a modern, visually appealing, and fully responsive user interface. Users can select a tour, enter their personal details, and upon successful validation, the reservation is completed (the payment step is implemented as a mock flow).

The application uses JWT-based Authentication & Authorization to ensure secure access. Within their personal dashboard, users can manage and update their personal and banking information, view all booked tours, and access a detailed history of their transactions.
